## How to contribute

### Preliminaries
First, some preliminary reading:
* Make sure you're familiar with our [Way of Working](wiki), most notably how we use GitHub's *Issues*, *Discussions* and *Projects*.
* If you plan to make changes to code or documentation, read our [Guidelines](wiki) as well.

### Steps to take
Then, follow these steps to guide you through the process.

1. **Check out currently existing issues and discussions.** Look at [Issues](https://github.com/bartkl/metamorph/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/bartkl/metamorph/discussions).
    * Maybe what you consider doing is already being worked on, or at least there might be an issue for it.
    * It may inspire or influence you to gain new ideas, or to revise your current one(s).
2. **Create an issue or discussion where you describe your idea.** If a suitable issue/discussion exists already, carry on from there.<br />
    * This way we maintain an overview of our work inventory and planning.
    * It encourages you to think well about what it is you wish to contribute.
    * Others can help you refine and discuss your idea.
    * If for some reason you wish to deviate from this way of working, you are free to do so *at own risk* of rejection.

If your contribution involves making actual changes to the code or documentation, please continue reading.

3. **Make changes to the files on your own fork of the project.**
    * Make sure your changes conform to our [Guidelines](wiki).
    * Note that changes to the Wiki are a separate case. Please contact us if that's what you wish to do.
4. **Submit a pull request when you feel confident the work is done.**
    * The maintainers will review your code and request changes if necessary.
    * As soon as the changes are approved, your code will be merged.
5. **Close associated issues, discussions and pull requests.**
    * Clean up after yourself!
