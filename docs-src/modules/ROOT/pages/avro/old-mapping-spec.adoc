== Introduction

In this document an informal description will be provided of how an Apache Avro schema is generated from a SHACL shapes graph.

Roughly speaking we will be mapping SHACL node shapes onto Avro records or enum schemas. There will need to be a designated root node shape to start the transformation on, which corresponds to the root of the Avro schema.

Note there's either exactly one statement with predicate `sh:in`, or at least one with predicate `sh:property`, but not both.

==== Shape conjunction
===== `sh:and`
Using `sh:and` one can specify a list of shapes, all of which need to be conformed to. Currently, our implementation supports node shapes only.

For purposes in the context of Avro schema generation `sh:and` is interpreted to mean recursively combining all the properties of all the specified node shapes. As soon as there is no `sh:and` left to follow, the recursion bottoms out.

Furthermore:

* At most one `sh:and` statement is expected.


==== Enumerations
Each stated individual in the list value of the `sh:in` statement becomes an enum symbol.

==== Records
If there are `sh:property` statements about a node shape, it is mapped onto the Avro record type. Each of these property shapes are themselves mapped onto Avro record fields.

== Limitations and notes
Mapping a SHACL shapes graph onto an Avro schema means transforming a graph structure into a tree. Also, both have their own peculiarities. These lead to certain implications.

=== Root node shape
Since Avro schemas are trees, they have a root. It is therefore necessary to indicate what node shape represents this root.

IMPORTANT: There must be exactly one designated root node shape.

=== Ignored statements
Any node shapes, property shapes and in fact all statements that do not belong to any subgraph of the root node shape, will be ignored.

Designating a node shape to be the root node shape is currently done by stating a `rdfs:comment` with value `"RootObject"` for it.

=== Structural loops
****
https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#names[Named types] in Avro allow referring to an earlier defined type by its name. So, if a record `D` occurs more than once in the schema, only the first time will it be defined, and all subsequent times it is referred to by its name (`D`).

Note, however, that Avro does not support forward referencing: there is no way to use the name `D` in advance, the record must already be defined. A particular consequence of this is that during the definition of the `D` record schema - i.e. prior to having finished that definition - no reference to it can be made.

Now imagine the following example case where there's a structural loop in the shapes graph.

Node shape `A` has a property that refers to node shape `B`, which in turn has a property that refers to node shape `A` again. When we generate a record schema for `A`, at some point we'll generate the record `B` with a field that refers to the `A` record again. However, since we haven't finished defining `A` yet, we can't reference it. In practice this leads to the application redefining the `A` record, which for the same reasons causes `B` to also be redefined (assuming it too wasn't defined earlier), which causes another redefinition of `A`, and so on. The program hangs and probably runs into a stack overflow at some point.

To elimiate this issue, properties that cause it are simply ignored in the transformation.
****

=== Limited cardinality support
Avro schemas only support cardinalities of `0`, `1` and `*` (more than `1`). The mapping table shows how to deal with SHACL's finer grained cardinalities.
