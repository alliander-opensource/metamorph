= Backlog
https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues[GitHub issues] is used for the backlog.

When creating an issue, users are asked to choose what kind of issue they wish to create. There's templates set up for each type to help out the user and maintainer(s) with providing sufficient and helpful information.

After the issue has been submitted, a maintainer will assess it. After potentially asking for clarification one or more times, at some point the maintainer decides that the issue has one of three fates:

1. It won't be done.
2. It is more suited to become a discussion.
3. It is added to the backlog. Note this requires further preparation.
